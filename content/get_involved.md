## Projects for Undergraduate students
Below we have a selection of possible research projects for undergraduate students. Each project will explore some aspect of computational physics. Many more are possible. Please get in contact with your undergraduate advisor and select one!

### Classical Spin Systems
#### The Ising model in two dimensions
The Ising model in two dimensions can be solved analytically. Since its properties are known, it is often used as a benchmark for numerical methods in statistical mechanics. Use the classical spin code of ALPS, 'mc', to simulate the phase transition of the model. Perform a finite size analysis, finite size scaling, and be extra careful with error analysis and error propagation.

### Exact Diagonalization of Quantum Systems

### Spin Chains with Monte Carlo

### Spin Chains with DMRG

### Fermions
