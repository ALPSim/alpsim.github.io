## Correlation measurements in the directed loop and worm codes

In this tutorial we will look at measuring correlation functions in the directed loop and worm codes.

### Two-dimensional Heisenberg square lattice

#### Preparing and running the simulation from the command line

The parameter file `parm4` sets up Monte Carlo simulations of the quantum mechanical S=1/2 Heisenberg model on a square lattice and turns various measurement options on

    MODEL="spin";
    LATTICE="square lattice";
    REPRESENTATION="SSE";
    MEASURE[Correlations]=true;
    MEASURE[Structure Factor]=true;
    MEASURE[Green Function]=true;
    THERMALIZATION=10000;
    SWEEPS=500000;
    J= 1;
    L=4;
    W=4;
    T=0.3;
    {h=0.1;}
    
Using the standard sequence of commands you can run the simulation using the quantum SSE code and then look at the results in the XML output files

    parameter2xml parm4
    dirloop_sse --Tmin 10 --write-xml parm4.in.xml

#### Preparing and running the simulation using Python

To set up and run the simulation in Python we use the script `tutorial4.py`. The first parts of this script imports the required modules, prepares the input files as a list of Python dictionaries, writes the XML input files and runs the simulation:

    import pyalps

    parms = [{ 
            'LATTICE'                   : "square lattice", 
            'MODEL'                     : "spin",
            'MEASURE[Correlations]'     : True,
            'MEASURE[Structure Factor]' : True,
            'MEASURE[Green Function]'   : True,
            'local_S'                   : 0.5,
            'T'                         : 0.3,
            'J'                         : 1 ,
            'THERMALIZATION'            : 10000,
            'SWEEPS'                    : 500000,
            'L'                         : 4,
            'h'                         : 0.1
        }]

    input_file = pyalps.writeInputFiles('parm4',parms)
    res = pyalps.runApplication('dirloop_sse',input_file,Tmin=5)

To run this, launch your python interpreter using the convenience scripts `alpspython` or `vispython`. We now have the same output files as in the command line version.

#### Evaluating the simulation and preparing plots using Python

To look at the results we now load ALL measurements from output files starting with `parm4`. The script is again in `tutorial4.py`

    data = pyalps.loadMeasurements(pyalps.getResultFiles())

We now loop through all measurements and print them:

    for s in pyalps.flatten(data):
    if len(s.x)==1:
        print s.props['observable'], ' : ', s.y[0]
    else:
        for (x,y) in zip(s.x,s.y):
        print  s.props['observable'], x, ' : ', y

The `if` statement checks whether the measured quantity is a scalar or vector-valued quantity.

#### Setting up and running the simulation in Vistrails

To run the simulation in Vistrails open the file `mc-04-measurements.vt`.
