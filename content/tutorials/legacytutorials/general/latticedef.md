### How to specify lattices (graphs) within the ALPS-framework?

In this HOWTO we explain how lattices and graphs are specified within the ALPS-framework. In simulations for lattice models, it is then convenient to specify the lattice used for the simulation in an input file.

We explain the following issues:

- [How to specify a simple graph in terms of vertices and edges](../latticehowtos/simplegraph)
- [How to specify lattices and unit cells](../latticehowtos/unitcell)
- [How to specify graphs corresponding to a lattice with a unit cell](../latticehowtos/latticegraph)
- [How to create a library of lattices and graphs](../latticehowtos/library)
- [How to check a graph generated from a lattice definition](../latticehowtos/checklattice)

### Existing lattices (graphs) in the ALPS Lattice library
