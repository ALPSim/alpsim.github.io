title: Code-05 Vistrails Package
math: true

In this tutorial you will learn how to create your own package by making use of an existing ALPS-Vistrails module. We proceed in a similar way as in the previous tutorial and create a directory "alpsising" in the vistrails userpackages directory, with the contents of the directory `alpsising`.

As in the previous tutorial you can now load the package "alpsising" by enabling it in the preferences for the module packages. You will find your IsingAlpsSimulation module ready for use. Check out the Vistrails file `vistrailspackage.vt` which will use this newly created package.
