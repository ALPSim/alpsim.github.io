You can combine the Python approach and the Vistrails approach of running a simulation using the PythonSource module within Vistrails. Especially for testing purposes it is very convenient to use a PythonSource module first before creating a custom-made module in Vistrails. In `pythonsourcetutorial.vt` you will find an example for an Ising simulation, where we used this hybrid approach.
