## Main Issues Discussed

### Governance Structure

We discussed how to create the governance structure for ALPS in the meeting. The main purpose of the structure is for ALPS to become sustainable after the funding ends. The [governance documents](../../../govern#alps-governance-documents) is the result of the discussion.

### Webpage Construction

We discussed how to create user friendly webpages, providing more helpful information for new users onboarding the ALPS package. This includes reorganizing the historical webpage contents and creating new contents for easier and more logical navigation through the webpages.

### Tutorials

We discussed testing the available tutorials by students joining the ALPS project. Students will also record videos about the process of running ALPS, which will be posted on the [ALPS collaboration Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAHeoKQPv6WnQ1NZAllvKVg) and linked to the specific pages on the ALPS website. We also talked about creating new tutorials for quantum computation and pedagogical topics.
