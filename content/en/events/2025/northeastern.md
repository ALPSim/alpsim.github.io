## Location

The meeting has been held at Northeastern University in Boston. The workshop venue is the Alumni Center. You can find all the information, including directions, at [this link](https://alumni.northeastern.edu/events/alumni-center/).

To get to campus, you can either walk for about 10-15 minutes, along Huntington St, or take the E line, direction Heath St. for one stop and get off at Northeastern. A very nice and pleasant walk that will take you directly to the venue is along the Southwest corridor: walk toward Huntington Ave., cross the street and continue on Newton St for one block, and turn right. When you reach Massachusetts Ave, follow to the left of the metro “T” Orange Line station.

We will not offer catered lunches or coffee, so please have breakfast before coming and you can grab lunch on many of the restaurants on Huntington St. (not that many, actually...). We can also plan for a lunch reservation at the faculty club. We are also working on organizing a group dinner on the 31st. 

## Accommodations

We will provide accommodations at the [Bevidere 60 residence](https://housing.northeastern.edu/60belvidere/). If you are staying at this on campus residence (on us), you will have your own room and private bathroom. **If you haven't sent me your estimated arrival and departure time, please, do it as soon as you get a chance.** 

The dorm is an annex to the Sheraton hotel in Back Bay, which is connected to the Hynes convention center and the Prudential Center shopping mall. While it is the same building as the hotel, the dorm has an independent entrance on the street. The person at the front desk will call the dorm manager, who will bring you the key card and instructions to access the building. The room has towels, and internet access through eduroam and the NUguest networks.

The dorm is at an exceptional location, at the heart of Back Bay. You can go to the mall for food (through the Hotel, 2nd floor, take the escalators in the lobby). [Pressed Cafe] (https://www.pressedcafe.com/menu-boston-ma) has a very eclectic and healthy menu (around the corner, on Huntington Ave). You’ll also find a variety of restaurants a couple of blocks away on Boylston St and on Newbury St (this is the most popular street in Boston for window shopping). You’ll find yet more places on Massachusetts Ave, around the Berklee School of Music. Last, but not least, there is an interesting and welcoming dive bar across the street, the Bukowsky.

**Very important: If you are leaving on the 2nd, the dorm closes for the summer at 12-noon. You need to leave the building before then.**

## Directions from the Airport

From Logan airport, you can use Uber, or public transportation. At your terminal you can take the Silver Line SL1 (free) to South Station; from there you transfer to the Red Line (direction Alewife) for two stops to Park St, and transfer again to the E line, direction Heath Street. You should get off at Prudential, exit to the left, and walk around the corner for 100 meters.

## Before the Meeting

At this moment, **We kindly ask you to send us a title for your talk, if you intend to give one,** so we can put together the program. The program will follow a similar format as our past workshop in Spain (you can find it [here](../sansebastian)).
