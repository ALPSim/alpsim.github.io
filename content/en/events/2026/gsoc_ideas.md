Below is a list of projects available in ALPS for GSoC application. 

- Implementating a Python API to allow for user-defined operators, quantum numbers, models and geometries.
- Creating Matlab wrappers for the same methods already implemented in PyALPS.
- Implementing a hash table for quantum numbers for DMRG simulations.
- Updating the MPI framework and scheduler for the Monte Carlo applications.
- Creating an ALPS AI agent that guides end users on our website to gather information efficiently.  Here prompts will help steer users to the correct place and the correct code.  The agent will effectively become an instructional resource for the code, algorithms, and physics ideas.
- Creating an ALPS AI agent to help write scripts to select models and algorithms inside ALPS.  The agent will also be trained to assist in plotting data. 
- Implementing a C++ numerical method for simulations with randomness.
- Adding MPI parallelization to efficiently handle disorder sampling workloads.
