Please provide a brief CV. You do not need a physics or scientific background to participate. You will be trained and guided to get you familiarized with the ALPS package, its structure and functionality. You will not be required to understand the algorithms per se, but to help build a software infrastructure around them.

In your application please include answers to the following questions:

- What interests you most about our project?
- As mentors and project coordinators, how can we get the best out of you?
- Is there anything that you’ll be studying or working on whilst working alongside us?

Once you have selected a project assignment from the [ideas page](../gsoc_ideas), please include a well-defined, weekly schedule with clear milestones and deliverables around it.
