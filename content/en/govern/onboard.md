Dear Students,

We are excited to invite you to contribute to the ALPS (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations) project, a powerful and widely used software package for simulating quantum and classical many-body systems. ALPS provides state-of-the-art algorithms and libraries for researchers in condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, and related fields. Your contributions can help improve the accessibility, usability, and functionality of ALPS, benefiting the global scientific community.

## We Could Use Your Help!

There are several ways you can get involved, depending on your interests and skill level. Below are the tasks we are currently working on, with opportunities for students at all levels of expertise:

### Level 1: Webpage Design and Installation Feedback
- Task: Install ALPS on your system and document your experience. Provide feedback on the installation process, including any issues you encounter and suggestions for improvement.
- Goal: Help us streamline the installation process and improve the user experience for new ALPS users.
- Outcome: Your feedback will directly contribute to improving the ALPS documentation and installation guides.

### Level 2: Tutorial Construction
- Task: Develop tutorials for ALPS, including setting up simulations, running algorithms (e.g., Monte Carlo), and analyzing results. Write clear, step-by-step guides for the ALPS webpage.
- Goal: Make ALPS more accessible to new users by providing high-quality educational resources.
- Outcome: With serious commitment, your work on tutorials can lead to co-authorship on our next release paper.

### Level 3: Code and Library Management/Maintenance
- Task: Assist with code maintenance, bug fixes, and library management. Help improve the efficiency and reliability of ALPS algorithms and libraries.
- Goal: Ensure that ALPS remains a robust and reliable tool for researchers worldwide.
- Outcome: Gain hands-on experience with software development and contribute to a widely used scientific tool.

### Level 4: Research Code Contribution
- Task: Contribute to the development of new algorithms, libraries, or research codes within ALPS. Work on cutting-edge problems in computational physics.
- Goal: Expand the capabilities of ALPS and push the boundaries of what is possible in computational physics.
- Outcome: Collaborate with researchers worldwide and make significant contributions to the field.

## How to Get Started

1. Begin with Level 1: Install ALPS on your system and document your experience. Share your feedback and suggestions for improvement. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with the software and contribute meaningfully.
   
2. Move to Level 2: Once you are comfortable with ALPS, you can start working on tutorials. Learn more about Monte Carlo algorithms (or other methods if interested) and create educational materials for the ALPS webpage.

3. Advance to Higher Levels: If you are interested in software development or research, you can contribute to code maintenance, library management, or even develop new algorithms.

## Collaboration and Recognition

- Primary Platform: We work primarily via GitHub, where you can collaborate with the ALPS team and other contributors from around the world.
- Co-Authorship: With serious commitment to Level 2 or higher, you will have the opportunity to be a co-author on our next release paper.
- Learning Opportunities: Gain hands-on experience with Monte Carlo simulations (or other methods in ALPS), software development, and scientific research.

## Why Join ALPS?

- Impact: Your contributions will directly impact the global scientific community by improving a widely used tool for computational physics.
- Skill Development: Learn valuable skills in software development, scientific computing, and collaborative research.
- Networking: Collaborate with researchers and students from around the world.

## Ready to Get Started?

If you are interested in joining the ALPS collaboration, please reach out to us via GitHub or contact a member of the [ALPS Governing Council](../../govern#alps-community-steering-committee) directly. We look forward to working with you and seeing your contributions to this exciting project!

Best regards,  
The ALPS Collaboration
