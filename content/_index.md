## Welcome to the ALPS Software Package

The ALPS libraries aim to provide a set of well tested, robust, and standardized components for numerical simulations of condensed matter systems, incluing bosonic, fermionic, and spin systems. They consist of a set of components that are used in state of the art high performance codes.
