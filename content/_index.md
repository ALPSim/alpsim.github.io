## Welcome to the ALPS Software Package

The ALPS libraries aim to provide a set of well tested, robust, and standardized components for numerical simulations of condensed matter systems, incluing bosonic, fermionic, and spin systems. They consist of a set of components that are used in state-of-the-art high performance codes.

## Our Impacts
ALPS has been used by hundreds of researchers in 52 countries since its inception and has produced thousands of publications by different groups. We are pround of its contribution in advancing the understanding of material properties.

## Our Systems
One-, two-, and three-dimensional lattice systems with model parameters that describe real materials. 


## Our Collaborations
We are happy to collaborate with researcher and educators around the world on projects or codes that can have an ALPS application or can be included in the ALPS framework. If you are interested, please reach out to one of our steering committee members.
