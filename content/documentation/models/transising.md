The transverse field quantum Ising model is given by the Hamiltonian

$$
H=J_{z} \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} S^i_z S^j_z + \Gamma \sum_i S^i_x
$$

Here, the first sum runs over pairs of nearest neighbours. $\Gamma$ is referred to as transverse field; the system becomes critical for $\Gamma/J_z=\frac{1}{2}$. For $\Gamma=0$, the ground state is antiferromagnetic for $J\gt 0$ and ferromagnetic for $J \lt 0$. The system is exactly solvable ([P. Pfeuty, Annals of Physics: 57, 79-90 (1970)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0003491670902708?via%3Dihub)).
