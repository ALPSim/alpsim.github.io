    "## Quench of Hardcore Boson Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we investigate the behavior of the hardcore boson model\n",
    "$$H=-t\\sum_{i=1}^{L-1}(b_i^{\\dagger}b_{i+1}+b_ib_{i+1}^{\\dagger})+V\\sum_{i=1}^{L-1}n_in_{i+1}$$\n",
    "as the parameter $V$ is changed in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is well known that for large $V/t$ the ground state of the hardcore boson model at half filling is a charge-density wave (CDW) insulator, while for small $V/t$ the ground state is a superfluid (SF). It is interesting to consider what happens to the system if we begin in one phase and then dynamically change, or “quench”, one of the Hamiltonian parameters $t$ or $V$ such that we are in the other phase. As a simple first foray into the rich physics of quenches, we will consider quenching from one phase to the other and then back to the original phase. A particularly stringent criterion for adiabaticity of such a quench is how close the final state is to the initial state, i.e.,\n",
    "$$L(t;\\gamma)\\equiv |\\langle \\Psi(t)|\\Psi(0)\\rangle|^2$$\n",
    ", which we call the Loschmidt Echo. Note that the $t$ in this expression is the time and not the hopping parameter \n",
    "$t$. The parameter $\\gamma$ is meant to convey that this quantity in general depends on the manner in which the system is quenched.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general structure of a quench in the ALPS TEBD routines is given by the parameterization\n",
    "$$g(t)=g(t_i)+((t-t_i)/\\tau)^p(g(t_f)-g(t_i))$$\n",
    ", where $\\tau=t_f-t_i$ and $g$ is some Hamiltonian parameter. In the present case we will take $g$ to be the interaction parameter $V$. We will begin our system in the CDW regime with $V/t=10$, quench to the SF regime where \n",
    "$V/t=0$, and then quench back to the CDW regime with $V/t=10$. In the three parts of this tutorial we will investigate: a) the effects of the timescale $\\tau$ on the Loschmidt echo during a linear quench, b) the effects of “holding” the system in the SF phase for a time $\\tau_{\\text{hold}}$ before returning to the CDW phase, and c) the effects of changing the power $p$ of the quench function."

    "Let’s go through the TEBD-specific parameters in more detail. The parameter INITIAL_STATE is set to ground, which means that we begin from the ground state of our Hamiltonian with user-specified parameters. The parameters $t$ and $V$ specify that the initial Hamiltonian parameters $t=1$ and $V=10$ are used to find the ground state. In order to find the ground state, TEBD performs evolution in imaginary time. We refer to this step as ITP, and so all parameters containing ITP deal with the ground state properties. The vectors ITP_CHIS, ITP_DTS, and ITP_CONVS are the entanglement cutoff parameters, time steps, and convergence criteria for successive applications of imaginary time propagation. These constitute the main convergence parameters for TEBD, and convergence should always be carefully checked in each parameter. For now, don’t worry too much about their actual values, we’ll see how errors are controlled in the next set of tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we turn to the real-time propagation parameters. We wish to perform a series of two quenches. First we want to quench the parameter $V$ linearly in time from its initial value 10 to 0. Comparing with the general form of a quench \n",
    "$$g(t)=g(t_i)+((t-t_i)/tau)^p(g(t_f)-g(t_i))$$,\n",
    "we see that this corresponds to \n",
    "$g=V$, $g(t_i)=10$, $g(t_f)=0$, $p=1$, and $\\tau$ is the free parameter whose effects are to be investigated. Looking at the parameter list, we see that the first elements of the vectors GS, GIS, GFS, and POWS correspond to $g$, $g(t_i)$, $g(t_f)$, and $p$, respectively. The first element of the vector TAUS is looped over using the variable A, which means that we will perform a series of simulations with \n",
    "$\\tau=5, 10, 15, 25$, and 50. The second quench is essentially the reverse of the first, with $g=V$, $g(t_i)=0$, $g(t_f)=10$, $p=1$, and $\\tau$ the same as the first. Comparing with the parameters list, we see that this corresponds to the second elements of the vectors GS, GIS, etc. as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time evolution is simulated by breaking the full propagator approximately into a series of operations which act only on two neighboring sites at a time. The error in using this approximate propagator is second order in the “infinitesimal” timestep dt. TEBD gives a protocol for updating the canonical form of our state after such a two-site operation has been applied. The error in this procedure is controlled by CHI_LIMIT, which is directly related to the amount of spatial entanglement, and TRUNC_LIMIT, which is akin to the TRUNCATION_ERROR in the DMRG routines. The parameter vector NUMSTEPS specifies how many timesteps are taken in performing each quench, which together with $\\tau$ implicitly defines the timestep dt. The overall error is a nontrivial function of CHI_LIMIT, TRUNC_LIMIT, and NUMSTEPS which will be investigated in the next set of tutorials, so we won’t worry about the choice of these much for now. Finally, STEPSFORSTORE determines how many time steps are taken before observables are computed and stored and SIMID is an integer differentiating the simulations with different $\\tau$."
